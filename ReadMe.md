# Graphics technology programming course by MSUT "Stankin"
## The first laboratory
The first laboratory work is devoted to the construction of simple geometric shapes: a square, a cube, a toroid and a semi-ellipsoid. The folder with the first lab contains folders with projects for each figure. There is **start.sh** in the folder of each project. This file is the entry point. 

GLUT (The OpenGL Utility Toolkit) is required for starting the app.
